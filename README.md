## by Rich Jones
### v0.0.1

Add custom stylesheets to your Etherpad-Lite. Have a different style for readable and writable.

This is currently FUCKED. It works, but only in the hackiest ugly way. Plz halp.

## Installation

Just make sure you have this in your settings.json

    "ep_styles" : {
      readOnly_styleUrl: "http://static.mydomain.com/css/readonly.css",
      writeable_styleUrl: "http://static.mydomain.com/css/writable.css"
    }
